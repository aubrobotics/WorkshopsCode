# Workshops Code
This repo contains the code we develop during, and for, our awesome workshops.

---

### Workshop 1 : Introduction to Programming with Python
This workshop is intended to introduce students to programming and programming concepts using Python. It is meant to establish a solid foundation of programming that we build on in following workshops. The workshops will cover variables, loops, if conditions and functions.

### Workshop 2 : Intermediate Python Workshop
In this workshop, we'll learn why Python is so interesting in many fields. We will be learning and using the Python tools that are used everywhere, including - of course - Robotics! A quick rundown of the topics to be covered is:
- Brief recap on Python syntax
- Working with important libraries for Data Science and Numerical Computing, like Scipy, Numpy, and Matplotlib.
- Communicating with the OpenWeatherMaps API through Python Requests.
- Manipulating a large Dataset with the Pandas library.

### Workshop 3 : Introduction to Machine Learning
For this workshop we'll have a general overview of what machine learning really is, and how to build a basic machine learning model using Python!
A quick rundown of the topics to be covered is:
- visualizing and preprocessing the data
- discuss and build different machine learning algorithms
- postprocessing our results

### Workshop 4 : Introduction to Computer Vision
The aim of this workshop is to introduce participants to Computer Vision through both theoretical and hands-on experiences. The workshop is given in Python.
A quick rundown of the topics to be covered is:
- image filtering
- color spaces and transformations
- object detection, recognition, and tracking
